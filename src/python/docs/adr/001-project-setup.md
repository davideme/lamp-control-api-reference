# ADR 001: Project Setup and Language Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish the foundation for the lamp control API project in Python. This includes setting up the initial project structure and defining development practices that align with Python best practices.

## Decision

We have chosen Python as our primary programming language for the following reasons:

1. **Readability and Simplicity**: Python's clean syntax and readability make it ideal for rapid development and maintenance.
2. **Extensive Libraries**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for web services, data processing, and testing.
3. **Cross-platform Support**: Python runs on all major operating systems with consistent behavior.
4. **Strong Community**: Large community support with extensive documentation and resources.
5. **Type Annotations**: Support for optional type hints that improve code quality while maintaining Python's dynamic nature.

The project will follow a clean architecture approach with the following structure:

```
src/
├── domain/         # Business logic and entities
├── application/    # Use cases and application services
├── infrastructure/ # External interfaces and implementations
```

We will use:

- Poetry for dependency management
- pytest for testing
- pylint and flake8 for code quality
- mypy for optional static type checking

## Consequences

### Positive

- Rapid development with less boilerplate code
- Extensive library support for various components
- Clear separation of concerns through clean architecture
- Easier onboarding for Python developers
- Good readability and maintainability

### Negative

- Less compile-time safety compared to statically typed languages
- Performance limitations for certain high-throughput scenarios
- Package management can be complex (addressed through Poetry)
- Versioning and dependency conflicts can be challenging
