# ADR 005: FastAPI Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-01-10

## Context

The Python implementation of the Lamp Control API requires a web framework that can efficiently serve REST endpoints while maintaining consistency with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. The framework must support modern Python practices, provide excellent developer experience, and deliver high performance for API workloads.

Key requirements include:
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Strong type safety integration with Python type hints
- High performance for API operations
- Built-in request/response validation
- Easy testing capabilities
- Async/await support for scalable I/O operations
- Minimal boilerplate code

## Decision

We will use **FastAPI** as the web framework for the Python implementation.

### Implementation Details

- FastAPI version: 0.115.x or latest stable
- ASGI server: Uvicorn for development and production
- Data validation: Pydantic models (built-in with FastAPI)
- OpenAPI integration: Automatic generation from type hints and decorators
- Testing: TestClient for comprehensive API testing
- Async support: Native async/await for all endpoint handlers

## Rationale

### Advantages

1. **Automatic OpenAPI Generation**
   - Generates OpenAPI 3.0 specification automatically from code
   - Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc
   - Eliminates manual OpenAPI maintenance overhead
   - Ensures API documentation stays in sync with implementation

2. **Performance**
   - Built on Starlette and Pydantic for high performance
   - Benchmarks show performance comparable to Node.js and Go
   - Efficient async/await support for concurrent request handling
   - Minimal framework overhead

3. **Type Safety**
   - Deep integration with Python type hints
   - Runtime validation matches compile-time type annotations
   - Pydantic models provide automatic serialization/deserialization
   - IDE support with excellent autocompletion and type checking

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Intuitive API design following Python conventions
   - Minimal boilerplate code required
   - Built-in dependency injection system
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Easy testing with TestClient

5. **Modern Python Practices**
   - Built for Python 3.6+ with full async support
   - Leverages standard Python type hints (PEP 484)
   - Compatible with modern Python tools and practices
   - Active development and community support

6. **Validation & Security**
   - Automatic request/response validation using Pydantic
   - Built-in security utilities for authentication
   - Prevents common API vulnerabilities through validation
   - Proper error responses for invalid requests

### Disadvantages

1. **Learning Curve**
   - Different patterns from Django/Flask for developers familiar with those frameworks
   - Async programming concepts required for optimal performance
   - Pydantic model definitions needed for complex data structures

2. **Ecosystem Maturity**
   - Newer framework compared to Django/Flask (though rapidly maturing)
   - Fewer third-party packages specifically designed for FastAPI
   - Some enterprise-specific integrations may require custom development

3. **Async Requirements**
   - Async/await patterns required for best performance
   - Mixing sync/async code requires careful consideration
   - Database drivers need async support for optimal performance

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Django + Django REST Framework

**Pros:**
- Mature ecosystem with extensive third-party packages
- Built-in admin interface and ORM
- Comprehensive documentation and community support
- Battle-tested in enterprise environments

**Cons:**
- Heavier framework with more overhead for API-only applications
- Manual OpenAPI specification maintenance required
- Less optimal performance for API workloads
- Sync-first design with limited async support

### 2. Flask + Flask-RESTful

**Pros:**
- Lightweight and flexible
- Extensive ecosystem and community
- Familiar to many Python developers
- Fine-grained control over application structure

**Cons:**
- Manual OpenAPI specification generation required
- No built-in request/response validation
- Requires additional packages for API-specific features
- Limited async support without additional complexity

### 3. Quart

**Pros:**
- Flask-compatible API with async support
- Good performance characteristics
- Familiar Flask patterns with async capabilities

**Cons:**
- Smaller community compared to Flask/FastAPI
- Still requires manual OpenAPI generation
- Less integrated validation compared to FastAPI
- Newer framework with less enterprise adoption

### 4. Starlette

**Pros:**
- Lightweight ASGI framework (FastAPI is built on it)
- High performance with full async support
- Minimal overhead

**Cons:**
- Lower-level framework requiring more boilerplate
- No automatic OpenAPI generation
- Manual validation and serialization required
- Steeper learning curve for API development

## Implementation Notes

1. **Project Structure:**
   ```
   src/openapi_server/
   ├── main.py              # FastAPI application and configuration
   ├── apis/               # Generated API endpoint handlers
   ├── models/             # Pydantic models for requests/responses
   ├── impl/               # Business logic implementations
   └── repositories/       # Data access layer
   ```

2. **FastAPI Configuration:**
   ```python
   app = FastAPI(
       title="Lamp Control API",
       description="A simple API for controlling lamps",
       version="1.0.0",
   )
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Custom exception handlers for consistent error responses
   - Proper HTTP status codes following OpenAPI specification
   - Validation errors converted to appropriate API responses

4. **Testing Integration:**
   - TestClient for integration testing
   - Async test support with pytest-asyncio
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints

## Consequences

### Positive

- Rapid API development with minimal boilerplate
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation eliminates maintenance overhead
- High performance suitable for production workloads
- Strong type safety reduces runtime errors
- Excellent developer experience with modern Python practices
- Built-in validation ensures API contract compliance
- Easy integration with existing Python ecosystem

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers new to async programming
- Requires careful async/sync code organization
- Newer framework with potentially fewer enterprise-specific integrations
- Dependency on Pydantic for data modeling (though this is generally beneficial)
