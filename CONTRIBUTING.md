## Technical Capabilities

### Version Control

**Guidelines:**

- **Feature Branching**: Use short-lived feature branches named according to the format `[language]-[feature]`
- **Commit Messages**: Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:
  ```
  feat: add lamp on/off toggle endpoint to TypeScript REST API
  fix: resolve MongoDB connection issue in Go implementation
  docs: update API documentation for Python GraphQL interface
  test: add integration tests for PHP gRPC service
  refactor: improve Java repository pattern implementation
  ```
- **Pull Requests**: Create focused PRs that implement a single feature or fix
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed by at least one other contributor

**Implementation in this project:**

Each language implementation should follow the same Git workflow:
1. Create a branch for your specific implementation task
2. Commit frequently with clear, conventional commit messages
3. Push your branch daily to enable early feedback
4. Create a PR when the implementation meets acceptance criteria

### Continuous Integration

  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Linting and static analysis
  - Code coverage reports

**Implementation in this project:**

- Configure GitHub Actions workflows for each language implementation 
- Standardize CI pipeline steps across all languages where possible
- Generate code quality and test coverage badges for each implementation

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines based on the DORA Core Model and data modeling best practices, we can ensure that all language implementations in the project maintain consistent quality, follow best practices, and provide an excellent foundation for comparing different approaches.

These guidelines also ensure that the data models and operations are designed with future data warehouse integration and analytics in mind, making the system not just operationally sound but also analytically valuable.
