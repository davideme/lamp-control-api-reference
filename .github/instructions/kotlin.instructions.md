This Kotlin implementation of the lamp control API uses Ktor framework with modern Kotlin patterns.

Key frameworks and tools:
- Ktor 3.0.2 for web framework with Netty engine
- Kotlin 2.0.20 with serialization plugin
- Gradle 8.10.2 for build management
- OpenAPI Generator for code generation
- Logback for logging

When working on this codebase:
- Follow Kotlin 2.0.20+ features and idioms including coroutines
- Use Ktor patterns for routing, serialization, and middleware
- Maintain the established project structure with generated API code
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions and naming patterns
- Use Kotlin serialization for JSON handling
- Write tests following Kotlin testing best practices
- Use suspend functions for asynchronous operations
- Follow the established error handling patterns with proper HTTP status codes
- Maintain consistency with the lamp domain model and OpenAPI specification
- Use Gradle tasks defined in build.gradle.kts for development workflow
- Leverage Kotlin's type safety and null safety features
- Use dependency injection patterns established in the application structure
