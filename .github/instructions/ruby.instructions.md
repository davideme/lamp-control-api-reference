This Ruby implementation of the lamp control API supports multiple API styles and database technologies.

Key frameworks and features:
- Rails API for REST endpoints with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- GraphQL-Ruby for GraphQL implementation
- gRPC support for high-performance RPC communication
- Database support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB
- Ruby on Rails patterns and conventions
- Bundler for dependency management

When working on this codebase:
- Follow Ruby and Rails conventions for naming, structure, and patterns
- Use Rails API patterns for controllers, models, and routing
- Maintain support for all three API styles (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Follow the established project structure for multi-database support
- Write comprehensive tests using RSpec or Rails testing framework
- Use proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and Rails rescue patterns
- Maintain consistency with the lamp domain model across all API interfaces
- Follow Ruby style guidelines and best practices
- Use ActiveRecord or appropriate ORMs for database interactions
- Implement proper validation using Rails validators
- Use Rails middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Follow RESTful routing conventions in Rails
- Use gems appropriately for functionality extensions
