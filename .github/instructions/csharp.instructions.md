This C# implementation of the lamp control API uses ASP.NET Core with comprehensive code quality tools.

Key frameworks and tools:
- ASP.NET Core for web API framework
- .NET 8.0 for runtime and language features
- StyleCop Analyzers for code style enforcement
- Microsoft .NET Analyzers for code quality analysis
- EditorConfig for consistent formatting
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation

When working on this codebase:
- Follow .NET 8.0+ features and modern C# practices
- Use ASP.NET Core patterns for controllers, dependency injection, and middleware
- Follow StyleCop and .NET analyzer rules for code quality
- Maintain the established project structure and configuration
- Write comprehensive tests following .NET testing best practices
- Use async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Follow the established error handling patterns with proper HTTP status codes
- Maintain consistency with the lamp domain model and OpenAPI specification
- Use the Makefile targets for development workflow (build, test, lint, format)
- Follow EditorConfig formatting rules and naming conventions
- Leverage ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection container
- Use XML documentation for public APIs
