This Java implementation of the lamp control API uses Spring Boot with comprehensive code quality tools.

Key frameworks and tools:
- Spring Boot for web framework and dependency injection
- Java 17 for language features
- Maven for build management and dependency resolution
- SpringDoc for OpenAPI documentation generation
- Comprehensive code quality tools (StyleCop, PMD, SpotBugs, Checkstyle)
- TestContainers for integration testing
- JaCoCo for code coverage analysis

When working on this codebase:
- Follow Java 17+ features and modern Java practices
- Use Spring Boot patterns for controllers, services, and configuration
- Follow the established code quality standards enforced by multiple analyzers
- Write comprehensive tests including unit and integration tests with TestContainers
- Use Spring's dependency injection and annotation-driven configuration
- Follow the existing error handling patterns with proper HTTP status codes
- Maintain consistency with the lamp domain model and OpenAPI specification
- Use Maven profiles for different test execution scenarios (unit, integration, performance)
- Follow Google Java Format style guidelines
- Use JaCoCo for maintaining code coverage standards
- Leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration and starter dependencies
