# ADR-010: Python Version Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the Python implementation of the Lamp Control API, we need to select an appropriate Python version that balances modern features, long-term support, and ecosystem compatibility. The decision impacts development efficiency, maintainability, and future-proofing of the codebase.

## Decision

We will use Python 3.12 as the primary Python version for this project, with a minimum version requirement of 3.12.9.

Key factors influencing this decision:

1. **Support Timeline**
   - Released: October 2023
   - Security Support Until: October 2028
   - Provides 3.5 years of remaining security maintenance

2. **Technical Benefits**
   - ~5% performance improvement over Python 3.11
   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging
   - Improved type annotation syntax and checking
   - Better f-string parsing capabilities
   - Enhanced debugging and profiling API
   - Support for the buffer protocol

3. **Ecosystem Compatibility**
   - Wide adoption by major libraries and frameworks
   - Mature tooling support
   - Active security maintenance
   - Strong type checking capabilities

4. **Development Environment**
   - Virtual environment support
   - Compatible with modern development tools
   - Extensive documentation and community support

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Long-term Stability**
   - Security updates guaranteed until October 2028
   - Stable API and feature set
   - Regular maintenance releases

2. **Development Experience**
   - Modern language features
   - Improved performance
   - Better error messages and debugging
   - Enhanced type checking capabilities

3. **Ecosystem Benefits**
   - Wide library compatibility
   - Active community support
   - Mature tooling ecosystem

### Negative

1. **Version Management**
   - Development environments must maintain Python 3.12
   - CI/CD pipelines need specific version configuration
   - Some older libraries might not be fully optimized

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Teams need to familiarize with Python 3.12 features
   - Documentation may need updates for version-specific features

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Python 3.13**
   - **Why Not Selected:**
     - Released October 2024 (6 months ago)
     - Still in early adoption phase
     - Many ecosystem tools still stabilizing support
     - Limited real-world production usage data
     - Some key dependencies not yet fully tested

2. **Python 3.11**
   - **Why Not Selected:**
     - Support ends October 2027 (2.5 years remaining)
     - Lacks improved type checking features of 3.12
     - Missing performance improvements (~5% slower)
     - Does not include enhanced error messages
     - Most libraries now optimizing for 3.12+

3. **Python 3.10**
   - **Why Not Selected:**
     - Support ends October 2026 (1.5 years remaining)
     - Missing critical type annotation improvements
     - Lacks performance optimizations
     - Missing modern debugging capabilities
     - Would require earlier upgrade planning

## Implementation Notes

1. Development Environment Setup:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python --version  # Should show Python 3.12.x
   ```

2. Dependencies:
   - All dependencies will specify minimum Python 3.12 compatibility
   - `requirements.txt` will include version pins
   - Development tools will be configured for Python 3.12

3. CI/CD Configuration:
   - Build environments will use Python 3.12
   - Test matrices will include Python 3.12.x versions
   - Docker images will be based on Python 3.12
