# ADR 003: Offline-First API

## Context

To improve the reliability and user experience of the API, especially in scenarios with intermittent or no network connectivity, the API should support an offline-first approach. This ensures that clients can function seamlessly even when the network is unavailable.

## Decision

The API will adopt an offline-first strategy by leveraging caching mechanisms and conditional requests. This approach will prioritize local data availability and minimize unnecessary network calls.

### Implementation Details

1. **ETag Support**:
   - All read endpoints will include ETag headers in their responses.
   - Clients can use the `If-None-Match` header to perform conditional requests, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.

2. **Caching**:
   - Clients are encouraged to cache responses locally.
   - The API will provide appropriate cache-control headers to guide caching behavior.

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - For write operations, clients should handle conflicts gracefully by retrying or merging changes when necessary.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The API will return meaningful error codes and messages to help clients handle offline scenarios effectively.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - Improved user experience in offline or low-connectivity environments.
  - Reduced server load and bandwidth usage.
  - Enhanced performance for read operations.

- **Cons**:
  - Increased complexity in client-side implementation.
  - Potential challenges in conflict resolution for write operations.

## Status

Accepted
