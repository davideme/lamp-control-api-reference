# ADR 002: Node.js and npm Version Requirements

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Lamp Control API reference implementation requires a JavaScript runtime environment to execute. Selecting an appropriate Node.js version and corresponding npm version is critical for ensuring development consistency, deployment reliability, and access to modern language features while maintaining stability.

From analyzing the project dependencies and requirements, the application uses modern JavaScript/TypeScript features and has dependencies on packages that require recent Node.js capabilities.

## Decision
We will standardize on Node.js version 20.x or higher and npm version 10.x or higher as minimum requirements for development, testing, and deployment of the Lamp Control API.

### Implementation Details
- Required Node.js version: >= 20.x
- Required npm version: >= 10.x
- These requirements will be documented in:
  - README.md
  - package.json (via engines field)
  - CI/CD configuration files
  - Docker configuration files

## Rationale

### Advantages
1. **Long-Term Support**
   - Node.js 20 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release with support until April 2026
   - Ensures security updates and critical fixes for the foreseeable project lifecycle

2. **Modern JavaScript Features**
   - Full support for ES modules
   - Enhanced performance with V8 improvements
   - Support for modern syntax and APIs required by dependencies

3. **TypeScript Compatibility**
   - Better support for recent TypeScript features
   - Improved type-checking capabilities
   - Enhanced developer experience

4. **Security**
   - Regular security updates
   - Modern TLS and cryptographic capabilities
   - Improved dependency resolution in npm

5. **Performance Benefits**
   - Better memory management
   - Improved HTTP parser performance
   - Enhanced async/await implementation

6. **Tooling Compatibility**
   - Compatible with modern development tools and CI systems
   - Support for the latest testing frameworks

### Disadvantages
1. **Potential Environment Constraints**
   - Some deployment environments might not readily support Node.js 20
   - May require containerization for consistent deployment

2. **Upgrade Effort for Contributors**
   - Contributors with older Node.js installations will need to upgrade
   - Potential learning curve for new features

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Node.js 18.x
- Support ended in April 2025
- Still in use in some legacy environments
- Lacks newer performance improvements
- Missing features introduced in Node.js 20+

### 2. Node.js 22.x
- Latest LTS version with support until 2027
- Cutting-edge features and performance improvements
- Enhanced ES module support
- May have compatibility issues with some older packages
- Relatively newer, with less ecosystem testing

### 3. Deno Runtime
- Improved security model with permission system
- Built-in TypeScript support without configuration
- Native ES modules without compatibility layers
- Built-in developer tools (formatter, linter, test runner)
- Smaller ecosystem and potentially limited compatibility with some npm packages
- Requires different deployment considerations

### 4. Bun Runtime
- Significantly faster startup and execution times
- Native bundler and package manager
- Drop-in replacement for Node.js with high compatibility
- Optimized for modern JavaScript and TypeScript
- May have inconsistent behavior with certain Node.js APIs
- Ecosystem still maturing for production use cases

### 5. Flexible Version Requirement
- Allow a wider range of Node.js versions
- Increases development and testing complexity
- May lead to inconsistent behavior across environments
- Creates ambiguity for contributors

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent development environment
- Access to modern language features
- Long-term support and security updates
- Better performance and developer experience

### Negative
- Contributors need specific environment setups
- Potential deployment constraints in some environments
- Regular updates required to maintain security

## Related Decisions
- TypeScript version and configuration
- Development tooling selection
- CI/CD pipeline requirements
- Containerization strategy

## Notes
- Consider documenting Node.js upgrade paths for contributors
- Regularly review the Node.js release schedule for future updates
- Add automated version checks in CI/CD workflows
- Consider providing a Dockerfile or dev container configuration for consistency
