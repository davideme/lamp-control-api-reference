# ADR 004: TypeScript HTTP Framework Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our project requires a robust, type-safe HTTP framework for building RESTful APIs in TypeScript. The selection of an appropriate framework is critical as it affects developer productivity, application performance, maintainability, and the overall architecture of our services.

## Decision
We will use **Fastify** as our TypeScript HTTP framework.

### Implementation Details
- Fastify version: 4.x or latest stable
- TypeScript integration via `@fastify/type-provider-typebox`
- Schema validation using TypeBox
- Plugin architecture for modular functionality

## Rationale

### Advantages
1. **Performance**
   - Consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest Node.js frameworks
   - Low memory footprint
   - Optimized request handling path

2. **Type Safety**
   - First-class TypeScript support
   - Schema-based validation with JSON Schema
   - Runtime type checking aligns with compile-time types

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Well-documented API
   - Growing ecosystem and community support
   - Plugin system for easy extension

4. **Validation & Security**
   - Built-in schema validation
   - Request/response validation out of the box
   - Reduces boilerplate code for input validation

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clear project structure
   - Active maintenance and regular updates
   - Solid plugin ecosystem

### Disadvantages
1. **Learning Curve**
   - Different paradigm from Express for developers familiar with it
   - Plugin-based architecture requires understanding of framework concepts

2. **Ecosystem Size**
   - Smaller ecosystem compared to Express (though growing rapidly)
   - May require custom solutions for some specialized needs

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Express.js with TypeScript
- Industry standard with massive ecosystem
- TypeScript support via `@types/express`
- Lower performance compared to alternatives
- Less integrated TypeScript experience (added via DefinitelyTyped)

### 2. NestJS
- Highly structured, opinionated framework
- Excellent TypeScript integration and DI system
- Steeper learning curve
- Potentially more overhead than needed for our use case
- Angular-inspired architecture may be excessive for some services

### 3. Hono
- Ultra-lightweight and modern
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Great for edge computing/serverless
- Smaller ecosystem and community
- Relatively new in the ecosystem

### 4. Koa with TypeScript
- Lightweight Express successor
- Middleware-focused architecture
- Less integrated TypeScript experience
- Smaller community than Express

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved performance over Express
- Better type safety across the application
- Reduced boilerplate through schema validation
- Simplified error handling
- Faster development cycles with better tooling

### Negative
- Migration cost for any existing Express-based services
- Learning curve for developers new to Fastify
- May need to develop custom plugins for some specialized needs

## Related Decisions
- API design and documentation strategy
- Error handling standards
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Testing approach for HTTP endpoints

## Notes
- Consider running performance benchmarks for our specific use cases
- Develop coding standards specific to Fastify usage
- Plan for knowledge sharing sessions for the team
- Investigate integration with existing monitoring tools
