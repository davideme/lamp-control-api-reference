# Code Metrics (SCC)

This directory contains code metrics reports generated by [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc) for each language implementation in this repository.

## Contents
- `scc-<language>.json`: SCC metrics for all files in the language's source directory.
- `scc-<language>-no-tests.json`: SCC metrics for the language's source directory, excluding test files (according to language-specific patterns).

These files are automatically updated by the CI workflow to provide up-to-date statistics on code size, complexity, and test coverage for each language implementation.
